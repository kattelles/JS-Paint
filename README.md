JS Paint is a modern paint studio, inspired by the classic MS Paint. It utilizes
Javascript, jQuery, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS.

## Features

Users (artists) have a variety of tools at their disposal: various sized brushes, a pencil, and eraser and a wide range of colors.

Users can also use the text input feature to add text to their canvas.
